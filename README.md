|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Adda247 Ad Removal](#adda247-ad-removal) | Blocks all Google AdMob ads (banner, interstitial, rewarded, rewarded interstitial, native, app open and Ad Manager) by neutralizing the Flutter Google Mobile Ads plugin: no ad is ever requested and no ad can ever be shown. |  |
| [Adda247 MoEngage In-App Blocker](#adda247-moengage-in-app-blocker) | Blocks the app's own MoEngage in-app promotions (the recurring "recommended for you" nudge with no close button, and full-screen standard in-app messages) by no-oping MoEngage's HTML render chokepoint, so no in-app WebView is ever built or attached.

## 💡 App Requests

> [!NOTE]
> **okish-morphe-patches** is a personal project I created for the apps and games I personally use.
>
> - **App requests are open**: If you'd like to suggest an app or a patch, feel free to open a feature request via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/byehi98/okish-morphe-patches/issues/new/choose).
> - **Discretionary pickup**: Whether a requested app will actually be picked up, investigated, or patched **totally depends on me** (based on whether I use the app, my personal interest, and available time).
> - Please understand there are no promises, guarantees, or ETAs for requested apps.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions and improvements are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these important guidelines:

### ⚠️ Rules for Pull Requests

1. **Work in the `dev` Branch (NOT `main`)**:
   - All contributions and pull requests **MUST be made against the `dev` branch, not `main`**.
   - PRs submitted against `main` will be closed or asked to be re-targeted to `dev`.
   - Merging from `dev` to `main` and version tagging is automated via CI release workflows.

2. **Strict Conventional Commits**:
   - Commit messages **MUST strictly follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format**.
   - The release pipeline uses Semantic Release to automatically calculate version bumps and generate changelogs based on commit prefixes:
     - `feat:` — New patch or new capability (triggers a **minor** release)
     - `fix:` — Bug fix in an existing patch (triggers a **patch** release)
     - `bump:` — Updating supported app target versions (triggers a **patch** release)
     - `docs:` — Documentation changes only (no release)

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. Check out a new branch based on **`dev`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-patch origin/dev
   ```
3. Implement your patch in `patches/src/main/kotlin/`.
4. Ensure your patch builds cleanly:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid
   ```
5. Commit your changes using conventional commit format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(app-name): add ad-blocking patch"
   ```
6. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request targeting the **`dev`** branch.
